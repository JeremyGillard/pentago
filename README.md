# Pentago

## Model Structure

## Additional Informations

Java build tool used: Ant

### Code

### Other
The commits structure are highly inspired by the Angular "Commit Message Conventions".

Briefly, the pattern look like this:

\<type\>(\<scope\>): \<subject\>
\<description\>
\<footer\>

NB: (Customization) In my projects, I will try at best to refer to parts of Model Structure for the header <scope>.
